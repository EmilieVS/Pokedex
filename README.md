# Pokedex

This is an exercice for my school. 
I realised I can now code in 3 languages but I've showed nothing in Python so far on my GitHub. 
This is the language I've started programming with and I'm a Pokemon fan.

So let's have fun and catch them all (with Python) !

# Let's make this fun and make my own Pokedex !

I've just made my first mobile app and loved it ! 
So let's take this litte app and turn it to an API.

Frontend will be mobile.
