># 💬 About the Project

This school project was designed to practice data parsing and logical structures.
It could be implemented in any programming language, but I decided to do it in Python, since it’s the first language I ever learned — and I’m a huge Pokémon fan, so it felt like the perfect fit!
________________________________________________________________________________________
># 🎯 Objectives

Practice JSON parsing and object manipulation

Strengthen understanding of loops and data structures

(Optionnal) Build a fun and functional mini Pokedex API 

## 🐾 So let’s have fun and catch them all (with Python)!  

># 📑 Project Guidelines

Work on data parsing, nested data structures, and loops by displaying statistics about Pokémon from a JSON database.
💭 Dataset: PokemonGO-Pokedex JSON

👤 The app should allow users to:

Load and parse the JSON dataset

Filter Pokémon based on criteria (e.g., weight > 10 kg)

Sort Pokémon 

Display possible evolutions for a given Pokémon
⚙️ This project focuses on backend logic and data manipulation rather than UI.

># 🧠 Exercise Steps
## Step 1 – Catch them all!

Load the provided .json file into your program.

Parse its content and structure the data into objects.

## Step 2 – Let them loop!

Write a function to answer:

How many Pokémon are in the dataset?

Which Pokémon weigh more than 10 kg?

Write another function to sort all Pokémon by ascending weight.

## Step 3 – Evolution

Create a function that, given a Pokémon’s name, displays all its possible evolutions.

Example: Bulbasaur → Ivysaur → Venusaur

## Step 4 – Pokedex

Build a small Pokedex interface or output that allows searching for a Pokémon and viewing all its details.

(Optional) Use a GUI library like JavaFX, or Swing if you’re implementing this in Java.
